## It's High Noon! - Made in C++

As my second major project for one of my second term modules, I wanted to increase the scope from the previous python work. After the console-based text adventure game I created, I wanted to expand into a graphical medium, and I decided upon a top down shooter. This gave me an opportunity to learn how to correctly set up and use a graphics library and I chose SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library).

I built upon many of the major aspects of novice programming that allowed me to expand upon what I already knew, including but not limited to: -

_Multi-dimensional vectors:_

```c++

    void DrawMapTiles(vector<vector<Vector2i>>(&Map), Sprite& Tiles, RenderWindow& GameScreen)
{
	for (int i = 0; i < Map.size(); i++)
	{	
		for (int j = 0; j < Map[i].size(); j++)
		{
			Tiles.setPosition(j * 16, i * 16);
			Tiles.setTextureRect(IntRect((Map)[i][j].x * 16, (Map)[i][j].y * 16, 16, 16));
			GameScreen.draw(Tiles);
		}
	}
}

//Creates the collision tiles, defined from a map text file
void CreateColTiles(vector<vector<Vector2i>>(&Map), vector<CollisionTile>(&ColTiles))
{
	for (int i = 0; i < Map.size(); i++)
	{
		for (int j = 0; j < Map[i].size(); j++)
		{
			if (Map[i][j].x == 0 && Map[i][j].y == 0)
			{
				CollisionTile CTile(Vector2f((j * 16), (i * 16)), Vector2f(16, 16), Color::Transparent);
				CTile.Collision = false;
				ColTiles.push_back(CTile);
			}
			else if (Map[i][j].x > 0 || Map[i][j].y > 0)
			{
				CollisionTile CTile(Vector2f((j * 16), (i * 16)), Vector2f(16, 16), Color::Transparent);
				CTile.Collision = true;
				ColTiles.push_back(CTile);
			}
		}
	}
}

```

_Classes and structs:_

```c++

    //Acts as the parent class for creating virtual screen objects.
    //All other screens inherit from this class.
    class cScreen
    {
    public:
	    virtual int Run(sf::RenderWindow &App) = 0;
    };

```
```c++

    //Header file for Player class
    //Player class contains all info and functions for the Player object.
    class Player
    {
    public:
        Player();
        ~Player();
        Player(Vector2f position, Vector2f size);
        void PlayerAction(Player &player, Vector2f screensize, vector<CollisionTile> &ColTiles, Clock &frameclock, Time &frametime);
        void CheckPlayerPos();
        void SetPlayerTexture(string TextureFile , Player &player);
        bool ColMap(CollisionTile tile);
        void ColEnemy(Player &player, vector<Enemy> &enemies, Clock &dmgclock, Time &sincedmg);
        int playerHP;
        RectangleShape playerRect;
        Texture playerTexture;

    private:
        float top, bottom, left, right;
        float maxSpeed;
        float minSpeed;
    };

_Storing and loading information from files, such as my custom sprite sheets that I created for the project:_

```c++

    //Loads and checks texture file.
    void SetTextureFile(string TextureFile, Texture& TileTexture, Sprite& Tiles)
    {
        TileTexture.loadFromFile(TextureFile);
        if (!TileTexture.loadFromFile(TextureFile))
        {
            cout << TextureFile << "is not present, cannot run program." << endl;;
        }
        Tiles.setTexture(TileTexture);
    }
```

_Creating the game world and collision from a tile set, allowing the user to edit the map and collision from notepad, without having to possess knowledge of programming:_

```c++

    while (!MapFile.eof())
    {
        string str;
        MapFile >> str;

        stringstream ss(str);
        vector<int> Coordinates;

        int i;

        //while the string stream loads each part of the string to i, ignoring commas, it pushes i onto the coordinate vector.
        while (ss >> i)
        {
            Coordinates.push_back(i);

            if (ss.peek() == ',')
                ss.ignore();
        }

        int FirstCord = Coordinates[0];
        int SecondCord = Coordinates[1];

        //The coordinate vectors are loaded into the map counters.
        MapCounter.push_back(Vector2i(SecondCord, FirstCord));

        //Map counter increases x counter every time it loops, and increases y if a newline is present in the file.
        if (MapFile.peek() == '\n')
        {
            //Added to the main map vector.
            Map.push_back(MapCounter);
            MapCounter.clear();
        }
    }
    //Last push back added so last line of the file is properly loaded.
    Map.push_back(MapCounter);

    //close the file
    MapFile.close();
    
```

_Using more advance calculations, such as firing the projectiles to the mouse pointer, and destroying them when out of bounds or on contact with collision:_

```c++

//Calculate projectile direction and velocity, amount of shots per click limited by timer
void Bullet::CalShot(Bullet &bullet, Clock &shotclock, Time &sinceshot, vector<Bullet> &bullets, RenderWindow &gamescreen, Player &player)
{
	Vector2f mousePos = gamescreen.mapPixelToCoords(Mouse::getPosition(gamescreen));
	Vector2f aimAngle = mousePos - Vector2f(player.playerRect.getPosition().x + (player.playerRect.getSize().x / 2), player.playerRect.getPosition().y + player.playerRect.getSize().y);
	Vector2f aimAngleNorm = aimAngle / (sqrt(pow(aimAngle.x, 2) + pow(aimAngle.y, 2)));

	if (Mouse::isButtonPressed(Mouse::Left))
	{
		sinceshot = shotclock.getElapsedTime();

		if (sinceshot.asSeconds() > 0.2)
		{
			bullet.bulletRect.setPosition(player.playerRect.getPosition().x + (player.playerRect.getSize().x / 2), player.playerRect.getPosition().y + player.playerRect.getSize().y);

			bullet.currentVelo = aimAngleNorm * bullet.maxSpeed;

			bullets.push_back(Bullet(bullet));
			shotclock.restart();
		}
	}
}

```

Overall, I was pleased with the result, and what I had learned from doing it. There are quite a few items I would have liked to add with a larger time frame, for example, implementing some A* algorithm pathfinding for the enemies, and hooking up sounds. While the latter would be simple the former is quite technical, and I have started looking into how pathfinding works to help me with further projects and my general understanding.
