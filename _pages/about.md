I'm currently in my second-year of studying Computer Science (Games Technology), at Nottingham Trent University in the UK. I'm an extremely passionate gamer and programmer, looking for every opportunity to expand my knowledge base and skill set to make my dreams of becoming a games designer a reality.

I'm a mature student, and coming back to education after being away from it for so long was a daunting prospect. Not only the financial implications, but also whether I could achieve what I wanted to. After all I had never really done anything with the scientific aspects of computing, I had never touched on programming at all so had no idea if I would even enjoy it! However, soon after I began my fears were assuaged, and I have loved learning everything about coding, mathematics and software design.

I feel extremely driven now that I have given myself a true sense of purpose and have made a commitment to working as hard as I can to get where I want.
