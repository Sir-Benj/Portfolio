    Welcome to my portfolio and development blog, here I show off some of my major projects
    created while studying, either as part of my course or in my own free time and also where 
    I talk about what I have been learning in regards to programming and game dev outside of 
    my studies. This ranges from new mathematical operations and programming practices through 
    to designs in Blender and game creations within Unity. To get started click on a few of the
    links below and enjoy your time exploring my world.
